# LBP-Based Segmentation of Defocus Blur




## Update2:
Add a python implementation to compute the sharpness metric.

## Update1:
The blur maps for the 1000 images in the [blur segmentation dataset](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/%7Eleojia/projects/dblurdetect/dataset.html) produced by our algorithm can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj4IQl4ug0_9hEANDaY7WjuOQkxW) for easy comparison.

##
This repo provides the code to reproduce our defocus segmentaion results  in our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7403985/).

## How to use

### Prerequistites
- Matlab 2016a

If you want to try out the python script, you need

- Python 3
- Opencv 3 (pip install opencv-python)

### Getting Started
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:xinario/defocus_segmentation.git
```

- In Matlab, change your project directiory to <your download path\>/defocus_segmentation then run demo.m

- Note that matlab implementation was used by default to compute the proposed sharpness metric. But you can also switch to .mex code to gain some speed boost. The sharpness metric implementation in .mex code was based on integral image and can run in real time on a single core cpu.

```
Compute the LBP-based sharpness measure using the mex version.

1. Install [mexopencv](https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv)

2. Copy lbpSharpness.cpp to <your mexopencv folder>/src/+cv 

3. Run mexopencv.make() in Matlab command line to compile the provided function.

4. Comment out line 14 and uncomment line 18, 19 in localSharpScoreLBP.m, then you are good to go.

Note: you can change the features w,h accoring to the real size of the characters of your plate image

All the results reported in the paper were produced by the mex verison of LBP-based sharpness.
```

- To use python script
```

python lbpSharpness.py --input ./test_img/1.jpg
```
